I want you to build a full-featured, SEO-optimized, multilingual directory website for dog parks (Hundewiesen) in Germany, using the domain:

🌐 https://hundeparkfinder.de/

🔍 Step 1: Research & Scrape Dog Parks
Use Google Maps (or a reliable alternative) to gather data on dog parks in all major cities and regions in Germany.

For each dog park, collect the following:
Name of the park

Address

City and State

GPS coordinates (lat/lng)

Google Maps link

Phone number (if available)

Opening hours (if available)

Park Website (if available)

Scraped description from the website (if a site is found)

✅ Store the data in a CSV file:
hundewiesen_germany.csv

🌐 Step 2: Build Directory Website
Create a responsive, clean, and user-friendly website using the scraped data.

🔑 Features:
Homepage with intro text and featured parks

Search and filter by city, features, rating, etc.

Individual park detail pages (populated from the CSV)

Map view showing all parks (Google Maps or OpenStreetMap)

User submission form for new parks (with image upload)

Admin panel to manage parks and user submissions

📝 Step 3: Add Blog Section (CMS-powered)
Include a blog section that is easy to manage without coding.

Blog functionality:
WYSIWYG editor for rich text

Upload images/videos

SEO meta fields (title, description, slug)

Categories and tags

Draft/schedule/publish support

Clean URLs (e.g., /blog/hundewiese-tipps)
